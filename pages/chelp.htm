    changes to the Setup page (using just the default settings). To do that just click the
    &quot;Finish&quot; button. You can return at any time to make changes. If you don't want
    to make any changes at this time, at least set your passwords, items #11, #12 and #13.
    Remember these- there's no way to extract your Administrator password if you forget other
    than going through a bunch of hoops as explained on the Skillpill Ladder download site
    (http://www.skillpill.com)</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">(1) This text is what
    appears at the top of the browser in the title bar. It will be the same thing for all
    ladder pages.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(2) There are two ways a member can move up in rank. One
    way, the default, is that the winner of a match moves half way up to the loser position.
    The other way is that the winner moves directly to the loser position.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(3) You can block multiple signups from a single email
    address or allow it.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(4) As above, you can block multiple signups from the same
    IP. This doesn't always work because some people have a connection that uses a different
    IP each time.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(5) Some players like to use elaborate game names that use
    symbols in the name. You can allow this or not.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(6) The ladder keeps track of the top ten players, and
    these are shown on the start page, which is the page you get when you click the
    &quot;Welcome&quot; button. This display can be in the form of plain text or a scrolling
    Java applet. The applet scrolls smoothly, but takes longer to load.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(7) The Control Panel, which is a page where you can edit
    member info, shuts the ladder down whenever you enter that page. It remains shut down
    until you log out. If you get distracted and forget to log out, the ladder would be dead.
    So there is a time limit that will automatically log the Control Panel page out after some
    amount of time, which can be reset to extend the time. Enter the time limit in minutes in
    this box. If you don't logout and the ladder seems to be locked even though you aren't in
    the control panel, just log into the sysop control panel again then click the LOGOUT
    button.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(8) When people join the ladder they are sent an email
    message. Email is also sent to the winner when a losing member logs a game loss. The
    return address comes from this item, and if left blank, the server will place an address
    there. It's better that you use an email address for your site in this box.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(9) The &quot;About&quot; page shows the information in
    this box. You should put your site or group or name and email in this box, or whatever you
    prefer.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(10) As above, this is another line that you can use in the
    About page for helpers/contributors to the game effort.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(11) This is the password you will need to access the SYSOP
    Control Panel page. That's where you can edit user info in case somebody makes a mistake.
    You can also directly enter new members if someone has trouble joining. You can also
    change the Sysop password on that page.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(12) On the Control Panel page you can make a backup of the
    member info, games logged etc. You can then restore to that state at some later time. You
    can also clear the member stats to start all members from scratch with no games logged.
    And you can delete everyone to really start from scratch. You will need this password to
    do that.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(13) This is your &quot;big gun&quot; password. It allows
    you enter the Administrator Section and manage access to the SYSOP Control Panel page.
    Normally, the program only allows one person at a time into the Control Panel. And when
    someone is in that page the ladder is shut down and nobody else can get into the Control
    Panel page. This password, however, overrides this and gives access. You may want to share
    the password in #11, but the passwords for #12 and #13 would best be kept private.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(14) When members log the loss of a match they can enter
    comments about the game. This is a limit on how long the comments can be. While it may be
    nice to allow long comments, it does increase the load time. The comments, along with who
    was played, shows up in the recent games display.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(15) This sets the maximum number of recent games that will
    be displayed for each player when the mouse is moved over the &quot;RG&quot; links on the
    Game Ladder Status page.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(16) This sets the number of straight wins that are
    required to receive the &quot;Hot&quot; graphic, which goes beside the player name.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(17) This is the HTML tag for the &quot;Hot&quot; graphic.
    If you cnage the graphic you may need to change the height and width in this box.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(18) This is the number of straight losses that are
    required to receive the &quot;Cold&quot; graphic, which goes beside the player name.</font></p>
    <p><font SIZE="2" face="Arial">(19) This is the HTML tag for the &quot;Cold&quot; graphic.
    If you cnage the graphic you may need to change the height and width in this box.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(20) If a player has not had any match in this number of
    days he/she receives the &quot;Frozen&quot; graphic (INACTIVE)</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(21) This is the HTML tag for the &quot;Frozen&quot;
    (INACTIVE) graphic. If you change the graphic you may need to change the height and width
    in this box.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(22) When a person joins the ladder they are sent an email.
    In this box you can set the message that you want to send them. In this message you can
    use &quot;tokens&quot;. Tokens are a key word that represent certain information and that
    information replaces the token when the mail is sent. The default is set to provide the
    members with the info they need, and you may want to include additional info.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(23) This is the frame layout. It puts the navigator at the
    bottom of the page. You can modify this HTML code for a different layout.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(24) When the &quot;Show Ladder&quot; button is clicked
    there is a list of members and their rank shown. This list length can be set here. If you
    set it to 25, for example, then it will display 25 members on the page. The drop down menu
    will be set up to show groups of 25. You can set this to any number from 1 to whatever.
    Load time will be slow if you make this a large number. </font></td>
